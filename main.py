# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it
length = 10
# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it
width = 3
# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`

# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: " the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables.
